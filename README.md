# ðŸš€ Extract Metals
This repo contains Python codes to develop and identify mathematical models for recovery of metals from waste streams by solvent extraction methods. This is developed as part of the SUMER (Digitally Enabled Sustainable Metals Recycling for Circular Economies) project.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Sensitivity analysis (direct sensitivity analysis by forward differentiation)
- Adjoint sensitivity analysis
- PyTorch simulator
- Parameter estimation using PyTorch
- Computation of exact Fisher information matrix (FIM) (as negative Hessian of log-likelihood function)

## Requirements
- Python 3.10
- Numpy
- Scipy
- PyTorch

## ðŸ“¥ Installation
